                <h2>Plant Disease Detection Using Machine Learning Techniques</h2>
                <h3>Summary</h3>
                <summary>Agriculture is the main source of livelihood and also the backbone of the Indian economy. Due to various kinds of diseases, the production of plants have been severely affected. If the diseases are timely and accurately detected, the growth of the economic sector will increase rapidly. The traditional approach of disease detection and classification involves immense amounts of time, intense amounts of labor and constant monitoring of the farm. Diseases caused by bacteria, viruses and fungi are avoided by using disease detection methods. Machine Learning techniques are used to identify the affected leaf images. The various machine learning algorithms used to identify plant disease are discussed in this study. It was done in various steps such as image acquisition, image acquired, feature extraction, categorization of the illness and result display. Image analysis has been used which aims to identify the plant diseases. Which fertilizer should be used after detecting the illness of the plants has also been mentioned.</summary>

                <h2>Nanotechnology for the Detection of Plant Pathogens</h2>
                <h3>Summary</h3>
                <summary>The main reason for yield-limiting factors are plant pathogens. They are reducing crop productivity globally, posing serious problems for food security, which has become the biggest agricultural concern in the world. Because of the repeated application of chemical treatment, the pathogens have become less susceptible. Over spraying of chemicals is polluting the environment and mainly affecting soil mycobacteria. And thus it is very important for us to get  efficient diagnostic techniques for the rapid identification of plant pathogens in the early stages before infection becomes crucial. Most of the molecular approaches for rapid plant pathogen detection are very time consuming, costly, require skilled operations, and are generally not suitable for in-situ analysis. The scientists have introduced us with many nanotechnology tools. They are microneedle patches, nano barcoding, nano biosensors, nano barcoding, metal nanoparticles, miRNA based nano diagnosis etc. Plant protection is feasible if any of these nanotechnologies are used as they emerge as potential tools to improve the sensitivity, accuracy and rapidness of plant pathogen identification and facilitate high-throughput analysis. Also they are more quick, inexpensive and accurate plant pathogens diagnosis.</summary>

                <h2>Smart Plant: A Mobile Application for Plant Disease Detection  </h2>
                <h3>Summary</h3>
                <summary>The production of agricultural products is bigger in Indonesia than any other country in the world. The national economic development structure of Indonesia also relies on the agricultural sector. Young farmers most likely have more strength than old farmers. But it is a matter of sorrow that in Indonesia the majority of the farmers come from old people with an age interval from 50 to 60 years old. And because of being old they have low vision and do not have enough strength compared to young people. And because of that they cannot detect plant diseases like young farmers. Furthermore their knowledge is also outdated which is why they could not make any growth in the field of agriculture last few years. We have to utilize their strength to detect more plant disease in order to grow more plants. In Purwokerto, most of the farmers plant only tomatoes. That's why we had to limit this research for tomato diseases only. We have found out most of them used a deep structure of CNN to reach a high accuracy. But we proposed our own CNN model with less complexity but got 89% accuracy and also it is our plan to develop it for other plants also.</summary>

                <h2>Rice Plant Disease Detection Using IoT  </h2>
                <h3>Summary</h3>
                <summary>The IoT is making remarkable progress in the world nowadays. To enhance productivity and efficiency, the IoT is used everywhere. To determine whether the soil and the plants are normal or diseased, an automated system is presented. The development of the plants, the yield and the nature of horticulture items are greatly influenced by plant leaves and soil diseases. To recognize the presence of infection in the plant leaves and soil, this chapter is endeavoring to build up a mechanized framework. We detect the current status of the soil and the plant using different types of sensors. Such as pH, temperature, moisture, DHT 11 and TCS 3200. Through an Ethernet shield, we send those sensor values to an IoT server to be stored. After creating a framework to detect the current condition of the plant's environment, we analyze the current situation of the environment by comparing it with the healthy plant's actual condition. Then we show it on our constructed platform.</summary>

                <h2>Ensemble Classifier for Plant Disease Detection  </h2>
                <h3>Summary</h3>
                <summary>Image processing is a technique which extracts digital information from images. In the medical field; pattern recognition, video processing, color processing these image processing techniques have been applied in order to solve real world problems. In the agricultural field, these approaches have been found out to be effective. Because it predicts the crop yield, leaf disease detection, fruit disease detection, vegetable quality evaluation etc. Due to excessive use of fertilizer and insecticides, the quality of crops degraded to a huge extent. Moreover the plant diseases are generally detected by experts through naked eyes. For the detection of plant diseases from the leaves, the authors propose an ensemble model based on Random Forest and K-Nearest Neighbor(KNN) in this paper. On a benchmark dataset of Plant Disease images, this experiment has been carried out. The dataset consists of 1000 images of Healthy Leaves and three plant diseases i.e. Brown Rust, Early Blight and Late Blight. In four steps : Segmentation by K-Means Clustering, Feature Extraction by GCLM, Feature Selection by Random Forest and Classification of plant disease by KNN, this proposed approach works in. Tradition support vector machine (SVM) evaluated the performance of the proposed approach on the basis of three measures such as accuracy, precision and recall the result of the experiment revealed that the proposed approach outperformed SVM.</summary>
