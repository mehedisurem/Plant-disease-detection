            <p class="parag">The study covered a wide range of literature on CNN, image processing, machine learning, and application for plant disease diagnosis. [1] Provide a transfer learning-based model for spotting diseases in plant leaves is presented in this study. This paper proposes DenseNet201, a CNN classifier built on a transfer learning model.[2] Provide a theoretical idea of analyzing the DNA structures, volatile organic compounds released by the plant parts, and textures formed on plant parts like leaves, stems, and fruit that are useful in plant disease detection.[3] Proposed a paper that having the goal is to identify various plant infections by looking at the pictures. We can precisely identify the plant disease by using the CNN Algorithm.[4] In this part, the concurrent k-means clustering technique is used to identify the diseased leaf, after which features are extracted. To detect the types of sick leaves, reweighted KNN linear classification algorithms have been employed.[5] Influenced the rapid development of plant disease detection include the use of advanced technologies such as remote sensing, artificial intelligence, DNA-based methods and nanotechnology, as well as the development of rapid diagnostic tools for on-site testing.</p>

            <p class="parag">[6]To detect plant diseases, we are utilizing image processing with a Convolution neural network (CNN).[7]The image processing along with k-means clustering and convoluted neural networking algorithms could be used for the accurate prediction of the disease and the methods including image segregation, pre-processing data, fragmentation of the image, detection, and recognition of characteristics [8]image processing is used here for detection of diseases in multi-horticulture plants such as Alternaria alternata, anthracnose, bacterial blight, and cercospora leaf spot and also addition with the healthyleaves, the leaf is classified as healthy or unhealthy using the KNN approach, they classify the unhealthyleaf using PNN, SVM, and the KNN approach and the experimentation reveals that the fusion approach with PNN and SVM classifier outperforms KNN methods.[9] image sensors like RGB sensors, IR/thermal sensors, hyperspectral sensors, and multispectral sensors etc. along with computer vision approaches effectively utilized for the quick identification and classification of plant diseases. These applications of image sensing in plant pathology along with an Artificial Intelligence (AI) based decision support system could be a way forward in achieving precision agriculturewith enhanced protection against plant diseases.[10]By image processing we can detect plant diseases by capturing the images of the leaves and comparing it with the data sets.

            <p class="parag">[11]  Plant diseases are the primary cause of the decline in quality of it. As a result, a significant increase in product quality is made in order to reduce plant illnesses. Preprocessing, segmentation, feature extraction, and classification are the crucial four processes of an autonomous image processing system [12] In these methods required human intervention, which makes them less effective, time taking & it caused damage to crops in case of intra-crop weeding. In earlier times, Robots did not have the capability to detect and classify objects at realtime. [13] This paper presents novel algorithms and architecture for a Robot based agricultural implement. The application is for tilling the agricultural field. The hardware consists of a platform with four wheels and a mechanism to facilitate the forward, reverse and lateral movement of the wheels. [14] . This paper presents a state-of-the-art light detection and ranging (LiDAR) based autonomous navigation system for under-canopy agricultural robots. Under-canopy agricultural navigation has been a challenging problem because global navigation satellite system (GNSS) and other positioning sensors are prone to loss of accuracy due to attenuation and multi-path errors caused by crop leaves and stems [15] In this article, we discuss the issue facing farmers and attempt to find a solution using a recommendation system. With the use of our model, we can identify the farmer's ideal crop, find potential pest problems, and provide pest management methods.

            <p class="parag">[16] Machine learning approaches such as SVM, K-NN and CNN are used to distinguish diseased or non-diseased leaves. The analysis of the proposed model is well suited for CNN machine learning classification technique with a desired accuracy compared to other state of the art methods. [17] Nano-phytopathology is a cutting-edge science which uses nanotechnology for detecting, diagnosing and controlling plant disease and their pathogens at an early stage, owing to crop protection from epidemic diseases. [18] Here, we create a framework to detect   the    current condition of the plant's environment. Then, we analyze the current situation of the environment, by comparing it with the healthy plant's actual values, which we then show on our constructed platform. [19] our aim is to make daily use technology for old people, a high complexity model does not fit for this case. Therefore, we proposed our own CNN model with less complexity but got 89% accuracy. [20] The main aim of this work is it to detect plant diseases from the leaves. In this paper, the authors proposed an ensemble model based on Random Forest and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) for the detection of plant diseases from the leaves. The experimentation has been carried out on benchmark dataset of Plant Disease Images.

The precision of the proposed model is 92.46 percentage. [23] To detect plant diseases, we are utilizing image processing with a Convolution neural network (CNN). Along with vgg-19 model which is an advanced convolution model and train the model with the data for prediction
