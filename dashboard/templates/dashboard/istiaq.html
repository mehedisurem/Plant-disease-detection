                <h2>An Image Processing Method for Identifying Plant Diseases Based on Changes in Leaf Morphology</h2>
                <h3>Summary</h3>
                <summary>Plant diseases are the primary cause of the decline in quality of it.
                    As a result, a significant increase in product quality is made in order to reduce plant illnesses.
                    A significant source of income for the world's expanding population is agriculture.
                    Farmers hold the key to our nation's development.In the last three decades,
                    a variety of methods for detecting plant diseases have been suggested. Preprocessing,
                    segmentation, feature extraction, and classification are the crucial four processes of
                    an autonomous image processing system. This part displays the research's conclusions and
                    its critical analysis in a more advantageous manner. Picture segmentation is the division
                    of an image into several components. Segmentation is used to find any disease-related
                    regions in the picture. By merging comparable pixels during segmentation, the area
                    of interest is created. Numerous diseases in agriculture harm the leaves and fruits.
                    The literature review includes a variety of segmentation techniques to address these problems,
                    making it simple to spot the sick area of the picture. A prototype system for the early identification
                    of illnesses based on the morphological changes in plant leaves may be created using the suggested
                    methodology. This study aims to identify the five paddy diseases that primarily cause major production
                    loss, including bacterial blight, blast, brown spot, leaf strake, and rice tungro. The results of this
                    study may help individuals detect illnesses that affect paddy at an early stage, preventing
                    significant loss and enhancing farmers' economies. Five paddy diseases were the main emphasis
                    of the suggested strategy. There may be added many more illnesses in the future.
                    Therefore, not only can this method be used to anticipate paddy illnesses but also other plant diseases.
                    The disease's symptoms must be examined while other plant illnesses are being considered.
                    Revolutionary innovations are destroying traditional agriculture practises and opening up new, difficult
                    options. Cloud services help precision agriculture. Access to customer databases, supplier networks, and
                    billing systems increase its effectiveness</summary>

                <h2>Design of an Autonomous Agriculture Robot for Real Time Weed Detection using CNN.</h2>
                <h3>Summary</h3>
                <summary>Agriculture has always remained as an integral part of the world. As the human population
                    keeps on rising, the demand for food also increases and so is the dependency on the agriculture industry.
                    But in today's scenario because of low yield,less rainfall, etc., a dearth of manpower is created in this
                    agricultural sector and people are moving to live in the cities, and villages are becoming more and more
                    urbanized. Traditional Weed Management required methods like burying, cutting, or uprooting. Several tools
                    like finger weeders, brush weeders etc., were used which performed the above-mentioned operations. But
                    these methods required human intervention, which makes them less effective, time taking & it caused damage
                    to crops in case of intra-crop weeding. In earlier times, Robots did not have the capability to detect and
                    classify objects at realtime. Due to development in the field of imaging systems, robots were incorporated
                    with cameras, for example - Colour cameras performed the task of segmentation of plants while the spectral
                    cameras performed the task of classification of plants. Various image processing and Deep Learning
                    algorithms have made it possible to classify multiweed species and crops under outdoor illuminations.
                    This paper presents an idea of making an agriculture robot that is specifically used for the detection of
                    weeds. The hardware consisting of both mechanical and electronicssystems was proposed by considering
                    various key parameters. Data from various sensor plugins was acquired and processed using various filtering
                    and sensor fusion techniques to get important information like distance and angle to the destination which
                    is used for autonomous navigation of the robot. Simultaneous control of Linear and Rotational motion was
                    done on the robot which was used to reach the destination.</summary>

                <h2>DEVELOPMENT OF NOVEL ALGORITHMS AND ARCHITECTURE FOR A ROBOT BASED AGRICULTURAL IMPLEMENT</h2>
                <h3>Summary</h3>
                <summary>This paper presents novel algorithms and architecture for a Robot based agricultural
                    implement. The application is for tilling the agricultural field. The hardware consists of a
                    platform with four wheels and a mechanism to facilitate the forward, reverse and lateral
                    movement of the wheels. The flow charts for the entire operation of tilling the field by
                    Robotic vehicle are presented in this section. The tilling operation is carried out in the
                    following sequence:
                    1. Forward Movement
                     2. Lateral Movement and
                     3. Reverse Movement.
                     During the Forward or Reverse movement, if there is any obstacle detected, it is taken care
                     of by an appropriate Interrupt Service Routine. A Robot based agricultural implement system
                     has been developed using a customized IP Core. The Robotic System is designed using Verilog
                     with on-chip ports, ROM, and RAM. The instructions have been realized using Algorithmic
                     State Machine charts. The design conforms to RTL coding guidelines and is technology
                     independent. The test bench is also coded using Verilog in order to test the system design.
                     In the present work, the IP core is used to run tilling operation in a field. The field may
                     be tilled to the specified length, breadth and spacing between till lines. The depth of
                     tilling is also programmable. Currently, PID controller is under development in order to
                     achieve precise control of the wheels of the vehicle in a specified direction.

                <h2>Multi-Sensor Fusion based Robust Row Following for Compact Agricultural Robots</h2>
                <h3>Summary</h3>
                <summary>This paper presents a state-of-the-art light detection and ranging (LiDAR) based autonomous navigation
                    system for under-canopy agricultural robots. Under-canopy agricultural navigation has been a challenging
                    problem because global navigation satellite system (GNSS) and other positioning sensors are prone to loss of
                    accuracy due to attenuation and multi-path errors caused by crop leaves and stems. Robotics and digital
                    agriculture technologies hold great potential in improving the sustainability, productivity, and access to
                    agriculture. However, reliable autonomy remains the key challenge preventing widespread adoption of small
                    robots. Although there are a significant number of publications about the navigation systems for agbots
                    using different sensors such as global navigation satellite system (GNSS), light detection and ranging
                    (LiDAR), or cameras, they are predominantly focused on over-the-canopy robots and larger machines. Among the
                    limited work that exists in under-canopy navigation, extensive field validation in diverse real-world
                    conditions has not been performed and no other work has shown an extensive autonomous navigation as we show
                    in this paper for this type of environment.
                    Future Works:<nl>•	Reduction of the end-of-row interventions by a hybrid system between GNSS and the proposed system. This new system might help to improve the problem with the gaps.
                        •	 Addition of a classification step to check whether a scan is usable and also remove unwanted readings from objects other than the stalks.
                        •	Generalization of line to curve fitting. This would address curves and row convergence.
                        •	  Change of controller to accommodate a set of waypoints for the next few meters instead of using only the current cross-track error. The waypoints would represent the center of the lane.
                        •	Evaluation of maps and AI techniques to improve the performance of the robot navigation in under-canopy environments.</nl>

                    The intervention analysis has shown that three major problems remain. Heading estimation and convergence of
                    rows are present for lanes with frequent objects such as hanging leaves, fallen stalks, and high grass and
                    weeds, all capable of occluding the actual rows to be followed.

                <h2>Recommendation System for Crop Identification and Pest Control Technique in Agriculture</h2>
                <h3>Summary</h3>
                <summary>The majority of crops lost in agriculture are a result of incorrect crop selection for a given plot of land. Typically,
                    farmers are unaware of the criteria.
                    of the crop, including the soil's nutrients, moisture content, and other needs. Farmers may experience suffering as a result, both emotionally and financially. A farmer also frequently deals with pests and illnesses that might harm the crops they raise but that they are typically ignorant of at an early stage. In this article, we discuss the issue facing farmers and attempt to find a solution using a recommendation system. With the use of our model, we can identify the farmer's ideal crop, find potential pest problems, and provide pest management methods. We used the SVM classification model, the Decision Tree algorithm, and the Logistic Regression method in this study. We discovered that the SVM classification model provides more accuracy when compared to the other algorithms. Crop seeds are one type of investment because agriculture is such a significant component of our economy. It is crucial to make sure that even the smallest investment made in the agriculture industry is taken care of. So, it is crucial to confirm that the right crop has been chosen for a land holding and that it meets its needs in order to benefit the country as a whole and the farmer in particular. Our research work goal is to broaden this model's repertoire of soil properties and data.
