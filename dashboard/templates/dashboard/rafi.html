                <h2>Data Collection and Analysis Using IOT Device and Machine Learning Techniques forDisease Classification on Soybean Plant</h2>
                <h3>Summary</h3>
                <summary>Prospective yields have recently been decreased by infectious biotic and abiotic disorders by an average of 4%,
                    with many farmers in developing countries experiencing yield losses of up to 100%. Identification and treatment of plant
                    diseases are issues that affect farmers all over the world. In order to identify and assess plant illnesses from their
                    leaves and determine the number of pods on the soyabean plant, this article employs the convolution neural network (CNN)
                    model and bespoke object detection. They have gathered all the information on the symptoms of diseases that affect soybean plants,
                    including Yellow Mosaic, Soybean Rust, and Bacterial Blight. Their main data sources include web scarping and the Indian Institute of
                    Soybean Research (ICAR). Component that are used in this project are Convolution Neural network (CNN), Soybean leaf, Neural Network,
                    Sensors, Cameras. With the aid of a neural network, they have done object detection using image processing on the data to identify the type of
                    disease present on the leaf. Their model is trained on a TITAN RTX 24G GPU utilizing Keras with tensor Flow as a deep learning framework.
                    After dividing the dataset into 80 20 parts, they were able to get an Excellent highest accuracy rate of 99.56 percent with the EfficientNetB0 model
                    (80 percent data for training and 20 percent images for testing). The implemented deep-learning model offers greater prediction ability in
                    terms of both accuracy and loss when compared to other deep learning approaches.</summary>

                <h3>Summary</h3>
                <summary>This research focuses on a deep learning-based system for rice disease detection that consists of a machine learning application on a cloud server and an application on a smartphone.
                    Cloud server application is made using python programming language and smart phone application is made using React. They have collected information on a number of rice plant diseases,
                    including Brown Spot, Leaf Blast, and Hipsa, and they have taken 1600 photos from the Kaggle dataset to use in the implementation of their method. They used 80% data for training data and 20% for testing.
                    After implementing their method, they have found 100% train accuracy value and 60% test accuracy of 320 images.  Moreover, they discovered that Hipsa class illness identification is the most
                    accurate when compared to other diseases. They are currently working to improve their method. Along with a function like provide recommendations on how to treat diseases in plants.</summary>
